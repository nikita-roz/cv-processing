## OpenCV for Processing

**A Processing library for the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) computer vision library.**

OpenCV for Processing is based on OpenCV's official Java bindings. It attempts to provide convenient wrappers for common OpenCV functions that are friendly to beginners and feel familiar to the Processing environment.

See the included examples below for an overview of what's possible and links to the relevant example code. Complete documentation is available here:

**[OpenCV for Processing reference](http://atduskgreg.github.io/opencv-processing/reference/)**

OpenCV for Processing is based on the officially supported [OpenCV Java API](http://docs.opencv.org/java/), currently at version 2.4.5. In addition to using the wrapped functionality, you can import OpenCV modules and use any of its documented functions: [OpenCV javadocs](http://docs.opencv.org/java/). See the advanced examples (HistogramSkinDetection, DepthFromStereo, and Marker Detection) below for details. (This style of API was inspired by Kyle McDonald's [ofxCv addon](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv) for OpenFrameworks.) 

Contributions welcome.

### Installing

OpenCV for Processing currently supports Mac OSX, 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, 32- and 64-bit Linux. Android support is hopefully coming soon (pull requests welcome).

_NB: When running on the Mac, make sure you have Processing set to 64-bit mode in the Preferences_

#### LiveCamTest

Access a live camera and do image processing on the result, specifically face detection.

_Note: There's a bug that prevents live camera access in current versions of Processing 2.0 on machines with a Retina display._

#### FaceDetection

Detect faces in images.
